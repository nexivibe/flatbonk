## Weapon Acquisition

Players start with one weapon based on their chosen shape. Additional weapons can be acquired through:
- Level-up rewards (random weapon offered)
- Weapon pickups dropped by elite enemies (rare)

Maximum of **5 weapons** can be equipped at once. Each weapon fires independently on its own cooldown timer, allowing for devastating combined fire patterns.

## Combat Tips

1. **Weapon Synergy:** Combine weapons with different strengths - pair a high-damage slow weapon (Railgun) with a fast weapon (Rapid Fire) for consistent DPS.

2. **Positioning:** Some weapons like Spread Shot and Nova Burst work best when surrounded, while Railgun and Piercing Laser excel when enemies line up.

3. **Cooldown Management:** Weapons with longer cooldowns deal more burst damage. Save them for tough enemies or dangerous situations.

4. **Upgrade Priority:** Focus on upgrading your primary damage weapon first, then diversify with utility weapons.
